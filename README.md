## Synopsis

Built in Visual Studio 2015, this is a Windows app that works alongside powershell to add a csv list of contacts (not users) to an Exchange server. 

## Motivation

I made this to assist a client who was frequently adding/removing contacts from Exchange. This semi-automated the process.

## Installation

No installation. Just run this on the same server that Exchange lives on.
